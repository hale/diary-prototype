Im using the files from one of the provided BlueJ projects in Objects First... to experiment with unit testing in Eclipse.  I hope to complete the exercies starting on p171 using eclipse instead of bluej.  The group project has motivated me to learn about unit testing and familiarise myself with a better IDE.
